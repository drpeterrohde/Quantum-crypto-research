# distributed-consensus-networks

Consensus protocols in blockchain transactions suffer from scaling issues when adopting proof-of-work schemes. These schemes rely on parties competing to solve cryptographic puzzles for stakes in transactions and are inefficient due to an artificial reduction in their transaction rate when scaling up networks (to prevent inflation and multiple winners). Instead, we adopt proof-of-consensus schemes whereby autonomous networks of known parties are quantum randomly allocated into sub-networks to perform consensus on independent transactions. Such networks have their compliance tested during consensus and so are known as consensus networks. These schemes do not require stakes in transactions as they instead rely on mutual benefit and do not run into the scaling inefficiencies of proof-of-work schemes. The security of such a protocol is characterized by the trust between parties in the network (and additionally external clients), a dynamic quantity that changes over time.
