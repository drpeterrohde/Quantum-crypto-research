Your provided BibTeX entry seems mostly correct, but there's a small formatting issue and a missing closing curly brace for the author field. Here's the corrected version:

```bibtex
@inproceedings{MP12,
  author    = {Micciancio, Daniele
               and Peikert, Chris},
  editor    = {Pointcheval, David
               and Johansson, Thomas},
  title     = {Trapdoors for Lattices: Simpler, Tighter, Faster, Smaller},
  booktitle = {Advances in Cryptology -- EUROCRYPT 2012},
  year      = {2012},
  publisher = {Springer Berlin Heidelberg},
  address   = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
  pages     = {700--718},
  isbn      = {978-3-642-29011-4}
}
```

The only change made was adding a closing curly brace after the `isbn` field. This ensures that the entry is correctly formatted according to BibTeX syntax.

The scheme possesses the novel property of being robust against an adaptive chosen message attack: no adversary who first asks for and then receives signatures for messages of his choice (which may depend on previous signatures seen) can later forge the signature of even a single additional message.},

We prove that each of two straightforward fast heuristic procedures achieves this goal when applied to a lattice given by a Lovász-reduced basis. The verification of one of them requires proving a geometric feature of Lovász-reduced bases: a c 1 d lower bound on the angle between any member of the basis and the hyperplane generated by the other members, where c 1 = √2/3.},
